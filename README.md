## Essential Questions in Computer Science

**1. Interpreting User Needs and Implementing Them Into a Program:**
   - Interpreting user needs is a critical step in program development. It involves understanding the end-user's perspective, their problems, and what solutions they seek. To effectively implement these needs into a program, I start by engaging with the users, gathering feedback, and conducting thorough research. Creating user stories is immensely helpful in this process. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user. They focus on the user's needs and the value a feature will provide, ensuring that development efforts are user-centric and goal-oriented. By breaking down complex user needs into manageable user stories, I can prioritize features, plan iterations, and ensure that the final product aligns with user expectations.

   - **Enhancements Made:** During the SNHU Travel project, user stories were further refined to incorporate accessibility standards and security measures. These updates ensured inclusivity and safeguarded user data, enhancing the application's overall usability and reliability.

**2. Approaching Program Development and Incorporating Agile Processes:**
   - My approach to developing programs is iterative, adaptive, and user-focused. Agile methodologies are at the core of this approach. Agile processes, such as Scrum or Kanban, facilitate flexibility, continuous improvement, and rapid response to change. In my future development work, I hope to incorporate key agile practices like regular sprints, sprint retrospectives, and continuous integration and deployment. These practices not only improve the efficiency and quality of the development process but also ensure that the team can quickly adapt to changes and user feedback.

   - **Enhancements Made:** The SNHU Travel project adopted modular programming principles and robust error-handling mechanisms, improving the maintainability and reliability of the application. By integrating these enhancements into the Scrum framework, the project demonstrated the value of iterative refinement and adaptability.

**3. Being a Good Team Member in Software Development:**
   - Being a good team member in software development goes beyond technical skills. It encompasses effective communication, collaboration, and a commitment to shared goals. A good team member actively listens to others, respects diverse opinions, and contributes constructively to discussions. In agile environments, being adaptable, open to change, and willing to learn from failures is crucial. Additionally, a good team member should be proactive in sharing knowledge, supporting team members, and maintaining a positive and inclusive team culture. In software development, where complex problems often require collaborative solutions, these qualities are indispensable for the success of the team and the project.

   - **Enhancements Made:** Effective team collaboration was further emphasized during the retrospective analysis of the project. Improvements in communication strategies and the use of agile tools like JIRA ensured alignment among team members and enhanced overall project execution.
